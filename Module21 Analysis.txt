Module 21 DeepLearning


Overview:


The overall purpose of this analysis was to determine a satisfactory binary classifier that would predict above 75% whether applicants would be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


Data Preprocessing:


The target variables for this model were the ‘IS_SUCCESSFUL’ values which let us know which of the previous projects succeeded or not.


The feature variables were everything else except for the ‘EIN’ values which were dropped.


The reason that the ‘EIN’ was dropped and the other stayed was because that column seemed to be a less important identifier for this model.


The Model


For the specifics of the model I decided some things by chance and others to fit the model I had. I added 3 total layers with the first layer’s input_dim being dictated by the length of the X_train variable. For the activation layer I used the rectified linear activation function or relu for its high use and popularity in deep learning functions. 


The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 76%. Satisfying the requirements for this assignment. 


By adding back in the ‘NAME’ column to the feature variables I was able to get the necessary data points to increase the accuracy. 


Summary:


The overall results of the model were enough to satisfy the assignment. In the future perhaps with tweaks to how the ‘APPLICATION’, ‘CLASSIFICATION’ and ‘NAME’ were binned,  I could achieve a similar or better result. As is we have a satisfactory model that can predict with 76% accuracy whether or not a Alphabet Soup backed project will succeed.
